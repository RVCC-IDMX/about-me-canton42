                <p>Hello! I'm Nolan Canto, a tech enthusiast with a deep passion for IT and innovation. Based in Phillipsburg, NJ, I've spent years learning IT, with years ahead as well.</p>
                <p>I grew up using my parent's old Windows Vista desktop computer. It was very slow, but that's when I learned about the wonders of technology and the Internet. As I grew, I wanted to learn more about computers and programming in general. I took Computer Science at Warren County Technical School and I am now enrolled in Information Technology at Raritan Valley Community College.</p>
                <p>I believe in the power of technology to transform lives and am committed to making a positive impact in the IT world.</p>

            <h2>CSS Image Hover Effects</h2>

            <div>

                <p>
                    In the ever expanding world of web design, users interact with websites in subtle ways, ones in which developers might not take into account. 
                    CSS image hover effects are remarkable techniques that are used to further enhance and expand user interactivity on a webpage. 
                    From revealing text from under a captivating photo to highlighting names and important information, image hover effects can do many things to make webpages even more immersive and interactive! 
                    This effect triggers a visual change when a user hovers their cursor over an image, adding an interactive element to web pages. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    CSS image hover effects can have many use cases. For example, you can hide a caption underneath a photo or
                    play a unique animation when a photo is hovered over. You can use image hover effects as ways to access links that
                    traditional text can not. For example, hovering over an image of a map of hiking trails may lead to a seperate page detailing
                    each trail. These are just several ways that image hover effects can be used to highten a website's interactivity.
                </p>

                <p>
                    CSS hover effects are based on the :hover pseudo-class in CSS, which will detect whenever a user points their mouse over an image or any kind of text. 
                    By targeting image elements, web developers and graphic designers can create unique ways in which a user can interact with a webpage using images and text. 
                    The applications range from simple changes like altering an image's brightness or contrast to more complex transformations like transitions, rotations, and overlays.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There are a multitude of different types of image hover effects that can be used in CSS. 
                    These include opacity changes, color shifts, zoom (scale) and rotate, text overlays, and borders and shadows.
                    Opacity changes alter the opacity of an image. Color shifts apply a color filter to the image, which can change properties such as their hue and saturation.
                    Zoom and rotate can animate the image to zoom in or rotate. Text overlays can display text or icons over an image.
                    Finally, border and shadows can highlight an image and display a sense of depth.

                </p>

                <p>
                    When taking a look at the Photo Gallery section on my webpage, you can see how hovering over an image changes some
                    elements of the page. In this case, the black shadow underneath each image will turn white. The blue border surrounding each image
                    will change into a bright cyan color when an image is highlighted. These effects give this section a sense of depth
                    and interactivity that a plain unstyled image cannot achieve.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Below this blog is a CodePen embed by Naoya which showcases various effects that can be achieved by
                    using the :hover pseudo-class in CSS. In these examples, the author uses various effects and animations, such as
                    blur and color changes. There's even several animations, such as a glass-like shine animation and a water-like circle animation.
                    CSS image hover effects provide unique ways for developers and web designers to customize and further enhance images on their webpages while 
                    boosting user interactivity, fidelity, engagement, and immersion.
