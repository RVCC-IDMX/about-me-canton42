# Nolan Canto - About Me - README

This website has been created to serve as a biography for myself and to showcase various topics and media. It showcases various techniques and skills learned in the IDMX-225 course. Currently, this website features multiple types of media, a hero section, a contact form section, a gallery section, a custom SVG formatted logo, and a functioning navbar with hover effects.

## Color Scheme/Visual Design

For this website, I wanted to create a simplistic look reminiscent of old-school 80s/90s computers. My logo which is featured at the top of the site is directly inspired by the startup screen of the Commodore 64, an 8-bit home computer that was released in 1982. For the website itself, I wanted to switch up the colors, as the color palette on the C64 is a little hard to read for modern audiences. I aimed for the visual design to be friendly to users who prefer using dark mode on their devices.

Below is the list of HEX values which represent the main colors I used to create my website:

- '#ccc8fd' - The main color used for text on the website. It is a bright color that is a mixture of white, purple, and blue.
- '#2b2571' - The color used for the background of the website. It is a dark blue/purple color. 
- '#1e1b52' - The color used for the background of content on the website. It is a darker shade of blue/purple and contrasts better with the text on the website.

## Navbar

The navbar is an important part in making sure that a website can be accessed and navigated easily on a variety of devices. A lot of people nowadays prefer to casually browse the web on their smartphones, so for my website I've implemented a "hamburger" menu. It is a small icon located on the top of the screen that can only be seen on mobile screen sizes. When clicked, the menu will expand and show links to each section of the website. When one of the links is clicked, the menu will close again.
